- Work together and figure out the right problem/question
- Design works best when you’re given a problem to solve instead of a specific execution. 
- Both use data to make decisions.
- Communicate often. Over-communicate everything. Document everything. Hold kick-off meetings when you’re starting a project that clearly defines what the problems are. Go over what central blockers might be, what are we trying to sell for our users, what do we already know, etc. And when reviewing things, have a clear idea about the goal and feedback.
- Setting a clear vision of why we’re building a product, and what problem we are trying to solve. 
- The golden rule of design is that every product decision should be intentional. So designers give feedback by asking questions (“Have you considered… ?” “Why did you… ?” “What happens if… ?” ). This invites conversation and helps us learn the context of the other person’s work. Likewise, PMs would do well to critique a design by asking questions.
